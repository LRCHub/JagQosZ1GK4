If i told i was perfect i'd be lying
If there's something i'm not doing, girl i'm trying
I know I'm no angel, but I'm not so bad (no no no)
If you see me at the party conversating
That doesn't mean telephone numbers are exchanging
I know I'm no angel, but I'm not so bad

You should know, these
Beautiful girls all over the world,
I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby

It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking "maybe I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go

These Beautiful girls all over the world,
I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby

Beautiful girls
(Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby (N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
