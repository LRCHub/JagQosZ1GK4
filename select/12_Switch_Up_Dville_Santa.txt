Some people switch up
And they think I don't know this
I'm just grinding, I'm just keeping my focus
I'm never tripping, I'm stuck in my motion
Hop in a 'Maro, it's just for the coasting
Hop in a 'Maro, it's just for the ride

Slipping and dipping, don't know if it's right
Slipping and dipping, don't know if it's right

Don't get me wrong
You know I'm never (???) People switch up
And they think I won't notice
